## Introduction
The current voice assistants like Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Siri, etc., have only one source of input i.e., Voice. This renders the wide range of features presented by these assistants like voice controlled home systems, etc., useless for the Dumb Demographics of the society. But given the fact that we have a world wide standard available for these people to communicate, we decided to make a hardware extension for the Amazon Echo/Google Assistant/Apple Pod which involves a camera module, a microphone, and a speaker, so that the people who are dumb are not left behind in this world which is quickly venturing into the domains of Voice Enabled Controls and Smart Homes.

## Ideology
We are using the standard ASL language as a basis for the gesture recognition. Alexa records the gestures performed by the user, analyses them from a given set of commands, the one to which it matches with the maximum probability is chosen and then send to Alexa for a response to be generated which is then spoken out.
